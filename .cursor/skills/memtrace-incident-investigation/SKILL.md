description: "Always use for source-code bugs, incidents, regressions, production issues, failures, root cause analysis, what broke, or what changed when debugging. Do not start with Grep, Glob, rg, find, or manual file search for code causes; Memtrace combines symbol search, impact, call graph, and temporal history."

## Overview

Root cause investigation workflow for incidents, regressions, and production issues. Uses temporal analysis with the `recent` scoring mode to surface changes closest to the incident time, then traces blast radius and execution flows to identify the likely cause.

## Steps

### 1. Establish the timeline

Determine:
- **Incident time** — when did the problem start? (This becomes the `to` parameter)
- **Lookback window** — how far back to search? Start with 24 hours, expand if needed.
- **Repo(s)** — which services are affected? Call `list_indexed_repositories` to get repo_ids.

### 2. Surface recent changes near the incident

Call `get_evolution` with:
- `mode: "recent"` — temporal proximity weighting: `impact × exp(−0.5 × Δhours)`
- `from` — lookback start (e.g., 24 hours before incident)
- `to` — the incident timestamp
- `repo_id` — the affected repo

**Why `recent` mode?** It exponentially amplifies changes close to the incident time while still weighting by structural impact. A high-impact change made 1 hour before the incident scores much higher than the same change made 20 hours before.

**Success criteria:** A ranked list of changes, with the most likely culprits at the top.

### 3. Check for unexpected changes

Call `get_evolution` again with `mode: "novel"` on the same time window:
- Flags changes to rarely-modified code (high in_degree, low change frequency)
- A core utility that hasn't changed in 90 days suddenly changing near an incident is a strong signal

**Decision:** If `novel` mode surfaces different symbols than `recent` mode, investigate both — the root cause may be an unexpected change to stable infrastructure.

### 4. Trace the blast radius of top suspects

For the top 3–5 symbols from steps 2–3, call `get_impact` with `direction: upstream`:
- How many downstream consumers were affected?
- What execution flows pass through this symbol?

**Decision:** Prioritize symbols where the blast radius overlaps with the reported failure area.

### 5. Trace execution flows

Use `get_symbol_context` on the top suspects to see which processes (HTTP handlers, background jobs, etc.) they participate in.

**Decision:** If the incident is in a specific endpoint/flow, focus on suspects that are members of that process.

### 6. Build the full timeline for the suspect

Once you have a primary suspect, call `get_timeline` with the symbol name to see its full version history:
- What changed in each commit?
- When was the last "stable" version?
- Was the change a modification, or was it newly added?

### 7. Correlate with surrounding changes

Call `get_evolution` with mode `directional` to separate:
- **Added symbols** — new code introduced (potential new bugs)
- **Removed symbols** — deleted code (potential missing functionality)
- **Modified symbols** — changed behaviour (potential regressions)

### 8. Check historical coupling (cochange)

For the primary suspect, call `get_cochange_context`:
- Which symbols historically co-change with this one?
- If the blast radius from `get_impact` doesn't explain the failure area, check cochange partners — the coupling may be behavioral, not structural.

**Decision:** If a cochange partner is in the failure area but has no direct call relationship to the suspect, it's a hidden dependency — investigate both.

### 9. Replay the sub-commit implementation history (if needed)

If the suspect's commit history doesn't explain the intent, call `get_episode_replay`:
- What was tried before the final committed state?
- Was any approach attempted and reverted in the same session?
- The `attempted_and_reverted` hint often explains why seemingly-correct code was changed to something subtler.

## Report: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incident Timeline** — when it started, what was observed
2. **Most Likely Cause** — the top-ranked change(s) by `recent` mode with blast radius confirmation
3. **Supporting Evidence** — novelty signal (was this an unexpected change?), blast radius overlap with failure area, process membership overlap
4. **Change History** — full timeline of the suspect symbol
5. **Affected Scope** — all processes and downstream consumers impacted
6. **Remediation** — revert the change, fix forward, or mitigate

## Algorithm Selection Guide for Incidents

| Phase | Tool / Mode | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Initial triage | `get_evolution` `recent` | Time-weighted ranking surfaces changes near the incident |
| Anomaly detection | `get_evolution` `novel` | Catches unexpected changes to stable code |
| Scope assessment | `get_impact` | Ranks by structural significance (blast radius) |
| Hidden coupling | `get_cochange_context` | Surfaces behavioral coupling not in the call graph |
| Direction analysis | `get_evolution` `directional` | Separates added/removed/modified |
| Sub-commit intent | `get_episode_replay` | Reveals what was tried before the committed state |
| Quick summary | `get_evolution` `overview` | Fast module-level scan before deep-diving |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Starting with `impact` mode | Use `recent` first — time proximity is the strongest signal for incidents |
| Only looking at the most recent commit | The root cause may be from an earlier change whose effects were delayed |
| Ignoring `novel` mode | Unexpected changes to stable code are often the root cause |
| Not checking blast radius overlap | A change is only a suspect if its blast radius reaches the failure area |
| Stopping at call graph analysis | `get_cochange_context` finds hidden coupling — symbols that move together without calling each other |
| Reading only committed code | `get_episode_replay` reveals tried-and-reverted approaches that explain the current implementation |
