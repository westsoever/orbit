description: "Always use before source-code edits, refactors, API changes, renames, removals, PR reviews, or risk assessments when the user needs to know what will break. Do not manually grep references or browse files for impact; this workflow uses Memtrace graph context, impact, and change detection."

## Overview

Pre-change risk assessment workflow. Before modifying code, this workflow maps the full blast radius, identifies affected processes, checks recent change history for instability signals, and produces a risk-rated change plan.

## Steps

### 1. Identify what's being changed

Find the target symbol(s):
- Use `find_symbol` if the user named specific functions/classes
- Use `find_code` if the user described behaviour ("the authentication middleware")

Collect symbol IDs for all targets.

### 2. Get 360° context for each target

For each symbol, call `get_symbol_context`:
- Direct callers and callees
- Community membership (which module is this in?)
- Process membership (which execution flows does this participate in?)
- Cross-repo API callers (is this an endpoint called by other services?)

**Decision:** If cross-repo API callers exist, this change requires coordination with other teams. Flag this immediately.

### 3. Compute blast radius

For each target, call `get_impact` with `direction: both`:
- Upstream impact: what depends on this symbol
- Downstream impact: what this symbol depends on
- Risk rating: Low / Medium / High / Critical

**Decision:**
| Risk | Action |
|------|--------|
| Low | Proceed with standard testing |
| Medium | Review all direct callers; test affected processes |
| High | Plan incremental migration; consider feature flags |
| Critical | Full migration strategy; backward-compatible changes required |

### 4. Check temporal stability

Call `get_evolution` with mode `novel` for a 30-day window on the repo:
- Are any of the target symbols flagged as "rarely changing"? If so, this change is structurally surprising and deserves extra scrutiny.
- Have the target symbols been changing frequently? High churn + high impact = volatile hotspot.

### 5. Map affected execution flows

From step 2, you already know which processes are affected. For critical changes, use `analyze_relationships` with `query_type: find_callers` at `depth: 3` to trace the full transitive caller chain.

### 6. Produce the risk assessment

Synthesize into a change plan:

1. **Target(s)** — what's being changed and where
2. **Blast Radius** — number of direct/transitive dependents, risk rating
3. **Affected Processes** — which execution flows will be impacted
4. **Cross-Service Impact** — any external callers or consumers
5. **Stability Signal** — is this code stable (novel) or volatile (frequent changes)?
6. **Recommended Approach** — based on risk: direct change, incremental migration, or backward-compatible evolution
7. **Test Coverage** — which callers/processes to verify after the change

## Decision Points

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Risk = Critical | Recommend backward-compatible change + deprecation path |
| Cross-repo callers exist | Flag as requiring multi-service coordination |
| Symbol has high novelty score | Extra review — this rarely changes; make sure the change is intentional |
| Multiple processes affected | List each affected flow; recommend testing each one |
| Symbol is a bridge point | Change may disconnect parts of the architecture — verify alternative paths exist |
